# Sales-Analysis-using-Pandas

I have used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

To begin with, I have merged the 12 month data files, and then cleaned the data for the analysis, which includes:

-Drop NaN values from DataFrame
-Removing rows based on a condition
-Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Next is data exploration to explore and answer some business questions related to our data:

What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
What city sold the most product?
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
What products are most often sold together?
What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods.
